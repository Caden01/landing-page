# landing-page

For one of the projects on The Odin Project I had to create a landing page that uses flexbox to align and display all the different elements.  I went to Albania last summer to visit the country my girlfriend is from and to meet her family.  I thought I would make this landing page to show a little bit about Albania.

The photo of the people and castle were taken by me. 

The photo of the mountain is taken by Klajdi Cena.
